This repository contains code necessary for an analysis of missing data in the ABCD project. See also the [OSF project](https://osf.io/57xer/).

# Contents

The analysis has several components. Each subfolder contains its own documentation.

* *ABCD-Data-Import/* contains code necessary to process the raw ABCD tabulated data into an RMD file used for analysis. Coding syntax and descriptives are available in an [Rmd File](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mrpeverill/ABCD-rsFMRI-QCandMissingness/blob/main/ABCD-Data-Import/Import_Tabulated_Data.html).
* *ABCC_download/* contains code necessary to download and process the ABCC data.
* *ABCD-fastqc01/* contains code to process the abcd_fastqc01 table.
* *Supplement.Rmd* contains the code for the main analysis presented in the paper and supplementary information, and *Supplement.pdf* is the knit file.
* *Flux/* contains code to generate a poster which was presented at the Flux congress meeting in 2023. 
* *modelplanning.Rmd* contains code and descriptions of a basic simulation designed to test the feasibility of the analytic approach. Output is available in [modelplanning.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mrpeverill/ABCD-rsFMRI-QCandMissingness/blob/main/ABCD-Data-Import/modelplanning.html).
* *Supplemental_Tables_editable.xlsx* contains tables too large for the pdf supplement.
